# pyanova
An Anova Precision Cooker (Sous Vide) Bluetooth API Python Wrapper

[![pypi-pyanova](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pyanova.svg?style=flat-square)](https://pypi.org/project/pyanova/)

## Descirption

This is a Python wrapper of the [Anova Precision Cooker](https://anovaculinary.com/anova-precision-cooker/) (Sous Vide) API via the Bluetooth LE connection. Under the hood, it utilizes [peplin/pygatt](https://github.com/peplin/pygatt) for the Bluetooth LE communications.

The library is tested on [C.H.I.P](https://docs.getchip.com/chip.html) with Debian + Python 2.7 and Python 3.4

## Acknowledgements

* This work relies heavily on the researches from [dfrankland/sous-vide](https://github.com/dfrankland/sous-vide/), a very nice API for Node JS. Commands used in _pyanova_ are based on its [research on the Android APP APK](https://github.com/dfrankland/sous-vide/blob/master/docs/ble.md).
* Bluetooh LE communication is made easy with [pygatt](https://github.com/peplin/pygatt)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* [pygatt](https://github.com/peplin/pygatt) - specifically, it uses the [gatttool backend](https://github.com/peplin/pygatt/tree/master/pygatt/backends/gatttool)
* [bluez](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/bluetooth/bluez.git) - specifically, the gatttool backend requires [hcitool](https://github.com/pauloborges/bluez/blob/master/tools/hcitool.c), make sure you can find `hcitool` in your system.

### Install using Python pip
Once the prerequisite are satisfied, you can install _pyanova_ with pip: `pip install pyanova`

## Usage

> The GATTTool backend normally requires __root__ permission. Hence you might need to run your program with __root__ permission or [setup passwordless sudo for 'hcitool'](https://www.sudo.ws/man/sudoers.man.html).

### Automode
You can initialize PyAnova easily with automode which will automatically discover and connect to the first available Anova device

```python
from pyanova import pyanova

pa = pyanova.PyAnova()
pa.get_status()
```

### Manual mode
Alternatively, you can fully control the discover and connect phrases of an PyAnova object

```python
from pyanova import pyanova

pa = pyanova.PyAnova(auto_connect=False)
devices = pa.discover(list_all=False, timeout=3)
pa.connect_device(devices[0])
pa.get_status()
```

### TODO
* Support Anova Nano: https://github.com/c3V6a2Vy/pyanova/issues/10
* Unit tests
* Autogen docs
* Probably swtich to [pygattlib](https://bitbucket.org/OscarAcena/pygattlib)?
